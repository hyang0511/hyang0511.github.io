# About
I am a senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia, Multi-Modal Computing Group (the name is changed from Multimedia Search and Mining Group since Nov. 2022). We are hiring interns and researchers to work on low-level vision (image/video restoration and enhancement) and content creation (diffusion-based generation and image/video manipulation). If interested, feel free to email me with your CV.

I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science in 2019 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Dr. Baining Guo and Prof. Minyi Guo. During my Ph.D., I worked closely with Dr. Baoyuan Wang at Microsoft Research Asia. Before that, I received my B.S. in computer science in 2014 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. Yong Yu and Prof. Minyi Guo.

My research interest includes image/video restoration, image/video enhancement and GAN/diffusion-based content creation. I have published about 20 papers at the top international CV/AI conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS.
