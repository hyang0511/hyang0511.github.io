# About
I am a senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia, Multi-Modal Computing Group (the name is changed from Multimedia Search and Mining Group since Nov. 2022). We are hiring interns and researchers to work on low-level vision (image/video restoration and enhancement) and content creation (diffusion-based generation and image/video manipulation). If interested, feel free to email me with your CV.

I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science in 2019 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Dr. Baining Guo and Prof. Minyi Guo. During my Ph.D., I worked closely with Dr. Baoyuan Wang at Microsoft Research Asia. Before that, I received my B.S. in computer science in 2014 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. Yong Yu and Prof. Minyi Guo.

My research interest includes image/video restoration, image/video enhancement and GAN/diffusion-based content creation. I have published about 20 papers at the top international CV/AI conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS.

# Projects
- DaVinci Project [\[project\]](https://github.com/microsoft/DaVinci)

  The DaVinci project aims to solve the pain points of existing video enhancement and restoration tools, give full play to the advantages of AI technology and lower the threshold for users to process video footage. Currently, the toolkit includes general image super-resolution and conference meeting enhancement features.

<span class='anchor' id='activities'></span>

- SR Viewer [\[project\]](https://github.com/hyang0511/SR_Viewer)

  This is a simple toolkit to view and crop image patches for image/video super-resolution tasks. In image/video super-resolution, the authors usually need to show the full image with its zoom-in regions for better visualization. Using this toolkit, the authors can easily crop multiple zoom-in regions from multiple results. Both merged image and each crop patchs will be saved.
